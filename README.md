## Introduction

Our goal is to provide a fun outlet for youth to exercise their strategic planning skills, bond with their peers, and improve their knowledge of game theory through innovating the well-known board game, Risk, into a digital format. In terms of business objectives, we plan on selling this game virtually using an online game store known as itch.io. Link to download: TBA.
